Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  The DriverPass client wanted a project designed that would help users prepare for and pass their driving test. The system they wanted not only had practice tests, in person lessons, and educational information, but also connected to the BMV to keep up to date on all changing laws and rules as those changes happened. The client is likely a company that already offers driver training and is looking to expand their offerings and reach more peopole.
  
What did you do particularly well?
  I think I did much better in the documentation of the buisness requirements document than I did with the system design documentation.
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  The entire system design document. I would be more thorough with the diagrams, and give more detailed explanations of what was happening within those diagrams.
  
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  The user is probably going to always be the most important element of a system design. They are the ones who are going to have to work within the system on a day to day basis. Interpreting the user needs was done through processes of user interviews, surveys, and feedback from the users. After getting an idea of what they needed, those needs then became part of the system design as functions and features of the system.
  
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
  Start with communication with the users about what they need from the software to develop a good understanding of the needs and requirements of the system. From there, user-centered design with agile methods should be implemented as a way to get consistent feedback on how the product is meeting user needs and what other needs and requirements are showing up as part of the testing process.
